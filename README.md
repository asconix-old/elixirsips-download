_Download episodes from [Elixir Sips](http://elixirsips.com)_

## Project Setup

1. Install gems:

    ```shell
    $ bundle install
    ```

2. Remember to place your user and password:

    ```ruby
    def initialize
      (...)
      @username   = '<your_username>'
      @password   = '<your_password>'
    end
    ```

3. Fire up the console:

    ```shell
    $ rake console
    ```

### **Do magic**

You can list episodes:

```ruby
=> d = ElixirSips::Downloader.new
=> d.episodes # List all episodes.
```

Or list just one episode's info:

```ruby
=> d = ElixirSips::Downloader.new
=> d.episode 1 # List just episode 1 information.
```

Then download just one episode:

```ruby
=> d = ElixirSips::Downloader.new
=> d.download 1 # Download episode 1.
```

Or all of them:

```ruby
=> d = ElixirSips::Downloader.new
=> d.download_all # Download all episodes.
```

You can even run it from your shell and do a batch_download:

```shell
$ nohup rake batch_download &
$ jobs
[1]  + running    nohup rake batch_download
```



Warning
-------

Except for a few episodes, Elixir Sips is a paid screencast series. Therefore, please
don't redistribute the downloaded material. This downloader is
only an utility tool and doesn't substitute the subscription.

You should do no evil!


Acknowledgements
-------

If you're wondering why create yet-another-downloader, it's because [elixir-sips-downloader](https://github.com/benjamintanweihao/elixir-sips-downloader) is broken.

Also, the Go and Python script out there won't organize the files in separated directories or let you download just one episode at a time.

And the [ruby-tapas-downloader](https://github.com/stupied4ever/ruby-tapas-downloader) (which can be "easily" ported to work with elixir sips) is kinda overdesigned, I did get some ideas from there to make this one though.
